$30 gets you a whole chicken. $16 gets you a half. Both come with seasonal sides put together by chef Val Stryjewski. They also pair their chicken and sides with ciders from an impressive list of bottles and drafts put together by bar manager Amy Hartranft. The cider prices vary.
They start selling the fried chicken dinners at 5pm and go until they run out-which is generally around midnight.""",2017-03-16 11:00:02,1

the food delish I must say. I had the island burger which was a homemade juicy burger with crab meat and shrimp on the burger. I would have preferred the shrimp to he fried for s different contrast but it was still nose size shrimp and tasty. For my appetizer I ordered mussels which were delish but due to standing to eat due to my leg falling asleep due to the small bar stool it was not the ideal way I wanted to enjoy my mussels.
